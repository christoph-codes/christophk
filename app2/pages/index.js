          <h1>My Story</h1>
          <p>
            My full name is Christopher Kirk Jones and I was born and raised in
            Las Vegas, Nevada. I just left my second decade and I am married to
            my beautiful wife of 8 years and we have two happy kids together! I
            received my bachelors degree in graphic design from the University
            of Nevada Las Vegas. I started a branding and logo design business
            called{" "}
            <a href="https://thekirkconcept.com" target="_blank">
              The Kirk Concept
            </a>{" "}
            that I will always continue to grow. In addition to designing, I am
            a self-taught web developer since 2010 and started programming in
            2015. I‚Äôm a huge believer in do it if you want to learn it and that
            is how I got here today with many skillsets!
          </p>
          <p>
            I spend a lot of time with my family, looking at model homes with my
            wife whether we‚Äôre buying or not‚Ä¶lol. My faith in Jesus Christ is at
            the center of everything I do, so always expect a smile unless the
            Vegas sun is beaming on my eyelids. I enjoy the sport of football
            since I played at the age of seven all the way through college at{" "}

            I‚Äôm a Vegas-Everything fan. I‚Äôve never truly left the country yet,
            outside of Ensenada, Mexico, which I don‚Äôt feel counts as leaving
            the country because it is still connected to the U.S.. I try to read
            as many self help books as I can and watch a long list of Netflix
            shows. The Cosby Show and Fresh Prince are hands down the best shows
            to binge-watch.{" "}

          <h1>My Story</h1>
          <p>
            The Kirk Concept is all about getting companies excited about their
            brand. I provide custom logo/branding, graphic design, website
            development, and marketing services for all of my clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started this business right out of college in 2012 and it has been
            a part-time gig and worked full-time jobs as my primary source of
            income. Over the years I was most excited about creating brands that
            companies get excited about.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal is to have every company in Las Vegas excited about their
            own brand to the point where it becomes a marketing competition and
            not a quality/brand competition.
